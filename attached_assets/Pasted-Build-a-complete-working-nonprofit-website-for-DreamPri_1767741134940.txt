Build a complete, working nonprofit website for “DreamPrint Initiative”.

GOAL
Create a modern, trustworthy, warm nonprofit site that clearly explains:
1) WHY DreamPrint exists (historical context and policies behind today’s education inequities)
2) WHAT we do now (our current program model + curriculum)
3) Projects gallery (3D-printed project inspiration with images and proper credit to Thingiverse)
4) Contact page (form + info)

TECH STACK (required)
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- lucide-react icons
- framer-motion for subtle animations
- Responsive + accessible (semantic HTML, keyboard-friendly, good contrast)
- No broken imports; must run with `npm install` then `npm run dev`

SITE STRUCTURE / ROUTES (must implement)
- / (Home)
- /why (Why DreamPrint)
- /what-we-do (What We Do)
- /projects (Printed Projects)
- /contact (Contact)
- Also include: /privacy (simple), /404

NAV + FOOTER
Top sticky navbar with links to Home, Why, What We Do, Projects, Contact.
Footer includes mission one-liner, quick links, and social placeholders.

BRAND / DESIGN
- Style: warm, credible, modern nonprofit
- Colors: primary = deep blue; accent = gold; neutrals = slate/white (use Tailwind defaults, do not hardcode custom palettes)
- Typography: clean and readable; generous spacing; professional
- Add subtle motion (fade/slide) as sections enter

CONTENT MANAGEMENT (important)
Centralize all editable text in `src/content/siteContent.ts` (or similar).
Use reusable components: Hero, SectionHeading, FeatureGrid, StatsRow, Timeline, FAQ, CTA, TestimonialCard (even if testimonials are placeholders), ImageCard.

HOME PAGE (/)
Hero:
- Headline: “DreamPrint turns imagination into opportunity.”
- Subheadline: “We partner with underserved elementary students and families to bring career dreams to life through hands-on 3D design and 3D-printed models—supported by Northwestern University volunteers.”
- CTAs: “See What We Do” and “Get Involved”

Sections:
1) “Why this matters” (2–3 concise bullets + link to /why)
2) “What we do” (feature cards: mentorship, 3D design curriculum, teamwork, career exploration)
3) “How it works” (simple 4-step process)
4) Impact placeholder (stats row with placeholders: students served, schools partnered, volunteers, prints delivered)
5) Projects preview grid (link to /projects)
6) FAQ (4–6 Qs)
7) Final CTA: “Partner with us” + “Volunteer”

WHY PAGE (/why)
Purpose: explain historical context behind educational inequities in a clear, respectful, non-inflammatory way.
Include:
- A short intro explaining that today’s gaps are rooted in policy, not “individual effort.”
- A timeline section (use a vertical Timeline component) covering:
  - Redlining and housing segregation shaping school funding and neighborhood resources
  - Disinvestment patterns and unequal access to enrichment
  - The lasting effects on school budgets, extracurricular exposure, and networks
Important: keep claims general and widely accepted; avoid citing specific numbers unless provided.
End with “Why DreamPrint is a direct response” (connect inequities → lack of exposure/tools → DreamPrint provides access, mentorship, tangible learning).

WHAT WE DO PAGE (/what-we-do)
Explain DreamPrint’s current program:
- We provide 3D-printed models of students’ career aspirations
- We run a beginner-friendly 3D design curriculum (Tinkercad-style) and teamwork-based projects
- We partner with local schools and organizations (mention Books&Breakfast as a community partner)
- We serve 250+ students and siblings, organizing participants into small teams based on age and design interests to foster collaboration, mentorship, and shared purpose.
Curriculum section must include concrete examples:
- manipulating/combining basic shapes
- personalized items (name tags, keychains)
- household tools (phone stand, pencil holder)
- team projects + small friendly competitions
Also include:
- “Volunteer roles” (design mentors, print support, classroom helpers)
- “Partnerships” (schools, nonprofits)
- CTA buttons: “Contact us” and “Donate/Support” (donate can be placeholder link)

PROJECTS PAGE (/projects)
Create a gallery of “inspiration projects” with images.
Important requirement: include a clear credit + disclaimer:
- Header disclaimer: “Project images and models shown here are credited to their original creators on Thingiverse. DreamPrint does not claim ownership. Links provided for attribution.”
Implementation:
- Create a local data array of 12–18 projects in `siteContent.ts` with fields:
  - title
  - description (1 sentence)
  - creatorName
  - sourceName = “Thingiverse”
  - sourceUrl (placeholder if not known)
  - imageUrl (use local placeholder images in /public/projects/ OR use generic placeholder images)
- Do NOT scrape Thingiverse.
- Provide a clean grid with filter chips (e.g., “Tools”, “STEM”, “Art”, “Everyday”, “Accessibility”).
- Clicking a project opens a modal or detail panel with full attribution and a “View on Thingiverse” button.

CONTACT PAGE (/contact)
- Provide a working contact form with validation (name, email, subject, message).
- Form submission can be a client-side “success” toast + console log (no backend required).
- Include placeholders for:
  - email (info@dreamprint.org placeholder)
  - location (Evanston, IL)
  - Instagram/LinkedIn placeholders
- Add a “Partner with DreamPrint” section with checkboxes (School, Nonprofit, Volunteer, Sponsor).

SEO + POLISH
- Add metadata (title/description) per page.
- Add OpenGraph defaults.
- Add smooth scrolling where relevant.
- Add loading/empty states for Projects filter.
- Add a simple Privacy page (/privacy) describing what data the contact form collects.

DELIVERABLE
Generate all code in the Replit workspace. Ensure it runs immediately. Avoid TODOs that break execution.
